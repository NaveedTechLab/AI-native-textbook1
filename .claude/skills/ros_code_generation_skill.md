# ROS Code Generation Skill

## Purpose
This skill enables the generation of ROS 2 code for robotics applications in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. It provides specialized knowledge for creating nodes, publishers, subscribers, services, and actions.

## Capabilities
- Generate ROS 2 nodes in Python and C++
- Create topic-based communication patterns
- Implement service and action clients/servers
- Generate launch files for complex systems
- Create custom message and service definitions
- Set up parameter configurations
- Integrate with robot hardware interfaces
- Follow ROS 2 best practices and conventions

## Usage Context
- Invoked when users need ROS 2 code examples
- Used for textbook exercises and examples
- Applied to capstone project implementations
- Integrated with the AI textbook assistant

## Input Format
- Functionality requirements (publisher, subscriber, service, etc.)
- Programming language preference (Python/C++)
- Robot platform context (if applicable)
- Integration requirements with other nodes
- Performance and real-time constraints

## Output Format
- Complete, runnable ROS 2 code
- Package structure and dependencies
- Proper error handling and logging
- Comments and documentation
- Best practices annotations
- Links to relevant ROS 2 documentation

## Constraints
- Must follow ROS 2 coding standards
- Should be compatible with current ROS 2 distributions
- Must include proper error handling and safety checks
- Should consider real-time performance requirements
- Must be suitable for educational purposes
