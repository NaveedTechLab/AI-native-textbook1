## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to the AI-native interactive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This comprehensive resource combines cutting-edge robotics concepts with artificial intelligence to provide you with a deep understanding of embodied intelligence systems.

### What is Embodied Intelligence?

![Embodied Intelligence](/img/embodied-intelligence.jpg)

Embodied Intelligence represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems. It's the principle that true intelligence emerges not just from abstract computation, but from the interaction between an intelligent system and its physical environment. In the context of humanoid robotics, this means creating machines that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world much like humans do.

### Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four core modules:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding the Robot Operating System for distributed robotics
