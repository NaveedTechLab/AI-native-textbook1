# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to the AI-native interactive textbook on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics! This comprehensive resource combines cutting-edge robotics concepts with artificial intelligence to provide you with a deep understanding of embodied intelligence systems.

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied Intelligence represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with physical systems. It's the principle that true intelligence emerges not just from abstract computation, but from the interaction between an intelligent system and its physical environment. In the context of humanoid robotics, this means creating machines that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world much like humans do.

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into four core modules:

### 1. ROS 2 Fundamentals
Understanding the Robot Operating System for distributed robotics. Learn how to build modular, scalable robotic systems using ROS 2's powerful communication architecture.

### 2. Simulation Environments
Working with Gazebo and Unity for robot simulation. Master the tools that allow you to test and iterate on robotic designs before deploying to physical hardware.

### 3. NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem
Perception, navigation, and manipulation using Isaac libraries. Leverage NVIDIA's cutting-edge tools for building intelligent robotic applications.

### 4. Vision-Language-Action Models
Integrating perception, reasoning, and action. Explore the latest AI techniques that enable robots to understand and interact with their environment.

Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of how to develop intelligent humanoid robots.
